This project is a movie database where anyone can register and vote for their favorite titles, but only editors and administrators have the right to add new content.

In the data access layer, I am using JPA, Hibernate and Spring Data, and for database migration I am using Liquibase. There are two profiles created, which differ in the database engine used and where the uploded files are stored. 

I took care of an attractive layout for the application, using HTML, some JavaScript and CSS, and thanks to the use of Flexbox, the site is responsive and adapted to all screen sizes. Of course, the whole thing is connected by Spring MVC, the application is secured using Spring Security, and the configuration is based on Spring Boot. I am also using a tool that makes it easy to generate and manage test data.
