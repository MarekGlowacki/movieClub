Reclusive billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has operated for two years as the vigilante Batman, investigates the murder alongside the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD). Lieutenant James Gordon discovers a message that the Riddler left for Batman. The following night, the Riddler kills Commissioner Pete Savage and leaves another message for Batman.

Batman and Gordon discover that the Riddler left a thumb drive in Mitchell''s car containing images of Mitchell with a woman, Annika Kosolov, at the Iceberg Lounge—a nightclub operated by Oswald "The Penguin" Cobblepot, crime boss Carmine Falcone''s lieutenant. While the Penguin pleads ignorance, Batman notices that Selina Kyle, Annika''s roommate, works at the club as a waitress. When Annika disappears, Batman sends Selina to the Iceberg Lounge for answers and discovers that Savage was on Falcone''s payroll, as is district attorney Gil Colson.

The Riddler abducts Colson, straps a timed collar bomb to his neck, and sends him to interrupt Mitchell''s funeral. When Batman arrives, the Riddler calls him via Colson''s phone and threatens to detonate the bomb if Colson cannot answer three riddles. Colson refuses to answer the third—the name of the informant who gave the GCPD information that led to a historic drug bust ending gangster Salvatore Maroni''s operation—and is killed. Batman and Gordon deduce that the informant may be the Penguin and track him to a drug deal. They discover that Maroni''s operation transferred to Falcone, with many corrupt GCPD officers involved. Selina inadvertently exposes them when she arrives to steal money and discovers Annika''s corpse in the trunk of a car. After a car chase, Batman captures the Penguin, but he and Gordon learn the Penguin is not the informant.

Batman and Gordon follow the Riddler''s trail to the ruins of an orphanage funded by Bruce''s murdered parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, where they learn that the Riddler holds a grudge against the Wayne family. Bruce''s butler and caretaker, Alfred Pennyworth, is hospitalized after opening a letter bomb addressed to Bruce. The Riddler leaks evidence that Thomas, who was running for mayor before he was murdered, hired Falcone to kill a journalist who was writing a story about Martha''s family history of mental illness. Bruce confronts Alfred, who maintains that Thomas only asked Falcone to threaten the journalist into silence; Thomas planned to turn himself and Falcone over to the police once he found out Falcone murdered the journalist instead. Alfred believes that Falcone had Thomas and Martha killed to silence them.

Selina reveals to Batman that Falcone is her father. After learning that he killed Annika for discovering he was the informant, she tries to kill Falcone, but Batman and Gordon arrive in time to stop her. Gordon arrests Falcone, but the Riddler kills Falcone with a sniper rifle moments later. The Riddler is unmasked as forensic accountant Edward Nashton and incarcerated in Arkham State Hospital, where he tells Batman he took inspiration from him when targeting the corrupt. Batman learns that Nashton has planted car bombs around Gotham and cultivated an online following that plans to assassinate mayor-elect Bella Reál.

The bombs destroy the seawall around Gotham and flood the city. Nashton''s followers attempt to kill Reál, but Batman and Selina manage to stop them. In the aftermath, Nashton befriends another inmate,[a] while Selina deems Gotham beyond saving and leaves.

Astrophysicist Jürgen Voller informs his superiors the Lance is fake, but he has found half of Archimedes'' Dial, an Antikythera mechanism built by the ancient Syracusan mathematician Archimedes which reveals time fissures, allowing for possible time travel. Indy escapes onto a Berlin-bound train filled with looted antiquities and frees Basil. He obtains the Dial piece, and the two leap from the train just before Allied forces derail it.

In 1969, an elderly Indy is retiring from Hunter College in New York City. Marion has recently left him and filed for legal separation due to Indy''s depression after their son Mutt was killed in the Vietnam War. Indy''s goddaughter, archaeologist Helena Shaw, unexpectedly visits, claiming she wants to research the Dial. Indy warns that her late father, Basil, became obsessed studying the Dial before relinquishing it to Indy to destroy, which he never did.

As Indy and Helena retrieve the Dial half from the college archives, Voller''s accomplices attack them. The CIA assists Voller, now working for NASA as "Dr. Schmidt". Helena, revealed as an antiquities smuggler, absconds with the Dial to auction it on the black market. Indy is framed for two colleagues'' murders, forcing him to escape through the Apollo 11 moon landing parade, then an anti-war protest. He seeks out his old friend Sallah, now a New York cab driver.

Sallah surmises Helena will likely auction the Dial in Tangier, then helps Indy flee the country. At a Tangier hotel, Indy disrupts Helena''s illegal private auction, but Voller and his henchmen arrive and steal the artifact. Indy, Helena, and her teen sidekick Teddy Kumar chase them through the streets in a tuk-tuk. The CIA intercepts Voller after the U.S. government disavows him for going rogue, but his cohorts murder the agents and steal their helicopter.

Indy, Helena, and Teddy trail Voller to Greece and team up with Indy''s old friend Renaldo, a professional sea diver. Guided by Basil''s research, they dive to an ancient Aegean Sea shipwreck and retrieve a "graphikos" tablet containing directions to the Dial''s other half. Voller arrives and murders Renaldo. Indy''s group escapes and heads to Sicily, pursued by Voller.

Inside the Ear of Dionysius cavern, Indy and Helena find Archimedes'' tomb, the Dial''s second half, and a 20th century wristwatch on Archimedes'' skeletal arm. Voller appears and captures Indy, wounding him. Helena and Teddy escape and chase Voller. After reassembling the Dial, Voller reveals his plans to time travel back to 1939 to assassinate Adolf Hitler and help lead Germany to victory in World War II. At an airfield, Voller activates the Dial and locates a time fissure in the sky. Indy is held captive on Voller''s stolen plane while Helena stows away through its landing gear. Teddy follows them in another plane.

While approaching the fissure, Indy realizes that continental drift could have altered the timeline coordinates. Rather than 1939, the group arrives at the Siege of Syracuse in 212 BC. The warring armies shoot down Voller''s plane, believing it is a dragon. Indy and Helena parachute out just before the plane crashes, killing everyone aboard, while Teddy lands safely. Archimedes finds Voller''s body and wristwatch in the wreckage. He gives Indy the Dial but keeps the watch. Indy and Helena learn that Archimedes created the Dial to bring users from the future through fissures that lead only to 212 BC. As the fissure begins to collapse, Indy wants to remain behind, feeling he has nothing to return to. Helena, fearing a time paradox and unwilling to give up on him, knocks Indy unconscious.

Nate confides to Martin his guilt over being distant following his and his wife''s separation, after which she developed terminal cancer. The trip is to reconnect with his daughters.

The next day, Martin and the family tour the reserve''s restricted areas. Martin shows them a local lion pride and notices that one is injured. At a nearby Tsonga community, Martin discovers most of the population is dead. Suspecting a rogue, man-killing lion is responsible, Martin rushes back to report the finding. Nate encounters an injured Tsonga man on the road but is unable to save him. Martin is mauled as he tracks the lion. It then ambushes Nate, who takes cover in the car. Meredith speeds away but crashes into a tree, stranding them.

Martin radios Nate on a walkie-talkie, warning him to stay away, saying the lion is using Martin as bait to lure the others out. As the radio is out of range to contact help, Nate assembles a tranquilizer rifle. He confronts the lion, hoping to subdue it long enough to recover Martin and trek back to civilization. The lion attacks, and Meredith takes advantage of the distraction to save Martin. Norah stabs the lion with a tranquilizer dart after it knocks the gun from Nate''s hands, causing the lion to retreat. Meredith brings Martin back to the car, and Nate treats his wound.

As night falls, the now-recovering Martin speculates the lion went rogue after poachers killed its pride. Soon after, the poachers arrive and initially agree to transport the group to the village in exchange for payment. Tensions rise after the poachers spot Martin, an avid anti-poacher, inside the car. The lion attacks and scatters the poachers, killing most of them. Nate maneuvers his way past the lion and finds the poachers'' truck keys. Back at the car, Martin holds the lion off long enough to allow the sisters to escape, though Meredith sustains a deep laceration to her side. The car falls into a ravine and Martin sacrifices himself by setting off an explosion from the leaking gasoline, severely burning the lion. Nate starts the truck and races away with Meredith and Norah but has to stop the car before they run out of fuel. They leave the car and walk to an abandoned schoolhouse nearby.

At the abandoned schoolhouse, which the poachers used as their base, Nate treats Meredith''s wound and forages for water. The lion appears and stalks the girls, but Nate returns and scares it off. Locking his daughters inside a room, Nate promises to return after subduing the lion. After provoking the lion into chasing him, Nate lures it to the local lion pride which Martin helped raise. The rogue lion overtakes and mauls Nate, nearly killing him, until the pride males intervene and kill the rogue. A Mopani worker arrives and saves Nate as he falls unconscious.

The Maximal leader Apelinq sacrifices himself to allow the other Maximals to escape the planet before Unicron devours it. Now under the command of Optimus Primal, the Maximals flee to Earth with the key.

In 1994 Brooklyn, an ex-military electronics expert named Noah Diaz struggles to find a job to support his ill brother Kris and is convinced by his friend Reek to steal a Porsche 911 to sell only to discover that the car is the Autobot Mirage in disguise. Concurrently, museum intern Elena Wallace studies an ancient statue of a falcon bearing the Maximal symbol and accidentally breaks it open to reveal the Transwarp Key hidden inside. The key releases an energy pulse detected by Autobot leader Optimus Prime, who summons the other Autobots. Mirage is contacted in the middle of Noah''s attempted theft, and he is roped into the Autobots'' mission to recover the key from the museum so they can use it to return to their homeworld of Cybertron.

Drawn by the key''s signature, the Terrorcons arrive on Earth and attack the Autobots outside the museum, with Elena becoming caught up in the conflict. Scourge deactivates Bumblebee, steals the key, and retreats when the Maximal Airazor arrives. Airazor explains to the Autobots that the Maximals have been hiding on Earth for millennia and that Scourge only has half of the Transwarp Key, which was split in two to keep it away from Unicron. Despite the danger, Optimus insists that the key be reassembled so the Autobots can use it to return home, while Noah secretly plots to destroy the key to keep Earth safe.

Elena deduces that the other half of the key must be in a hidden temple in Peru, and the cargo plane Autobot, Stratosphere takes them to Peru. There, they meet with Wheeljack, who leads them to the temple, but they soon discover that the other half of the key is no longer there. The Terrorcons attack again, and the battle ends with Scourge corrupting Airazor with Unicron''s dark energy. Subsequently, the Autobots meet Optimus Primal and the other Maximals, who explain that they entrusted the second half of the key to a human tribe they have worked with for millennia. Scourge''s corruption overtakes Airazor and Primal reluctantly deactivates her at her request to save Elena. In the chaos, Noah attempts to destroy the second half of the key, but Optimus convinces him otherwise. Scourge steals it and then reassembles the two halves atop a volcano, erecting a tower and opening a portal above the Earth, which Unicron will soon go through.

Optimus and Noah agree to work together to protect their home worlds from Unicron. While the Autobots and Maximals battle the Terrorcon army, Noah and Elena sneak in close to the Key, planning to deactivate it with an access code Elena has uncovered. During the battle, Scourge gravely wounds Mirage, who was protecting Noah, but transforms his damaged body into a powered exo-suit for Noah so they can fight together. Bumblebee is reactivated when the key activates the Energon-infused valley. He helps the Autobots and Maximals turn the tide of the battle. Optimus kills Scourge, but not before the latter damages the control console to prevent the portal from being shut down. Optimus destroys the key and collapses the portal, willing to sacrifice himself, but Noah and Primal save him from being sucked into the imploding vortex, which destroys the remaining Terrorcon army.

Jaime''s sister Milagro manages to get him a job at Victoria''s mansion. However, both are fired after Jaime stops a confrontation between Victoria and her niece Jenny. Jenny later tells Jaime to meet her at Kord Tower the next day to discuss a "job opportunity".

The next day, Jenny finds that Victoria is using the Scarab for her One Man Army Corps (OMAC) projects. She steals the Scarab and avoids security by giving it to Jaime, hidden inside a Big Belly Burger to-go box. At home, Jaime''s family convinces him to open the Scarab box. When Jaime touches it, the Scarab activates and fuses with him, encasing him in an armored exoskeleton.

Jaime later finds Jenny for answers, rescuing her from Victoria''s armed forces. She tells Jaime that the Scarab is a sentient weapon and that it has willingly chosen Jaime to be its host.

Lawyer Matt Murdock gets Peter''s charges dropped, but the group grapples with negative publicity. After Peter, MJ, and Ned''s MIT applications are rejected, Peter goes to the New York Sanctum to ask Stephen Strange for help. Strange starts casting a spell that would make everyone forget Peter is Spider-Man, but it is corrupted when Peter repeatedly requests alterations to let his loved ones retain their memories, ultimately causing Strange to contain the spell to stop it.

At Strange''s suggestion, Peter tries to convince an MIT administrator to reconsider the applications of MJ and Ned, but is attacked by Otto Octavius. Octavius rips nanotechnology from Peter''s Iron Spider suit, which bonds with his mechanical tentacles and allows Peter to control them. As Norman Osborn arrives and attacks, Strange teleports Peter back to the Sanctum and locks Octavius in a cell next to Curt Connors. Strange explains that the corrupted spell summoned people from other universes within the multiverse who know Spider-Man''s identity. He orders Peter, MJ, and Ned to find and capture them; they locate and retrieve Max Dillon and Flint Marko at a military research facility.

Osborn reclaims control of himself from his split Green Goblin personality and destroys the Goblin mask. He goes to a F.E.A.S.T. building, where May comforts him before Peter retrieves him. While discussing their battles with Spider-Man, Osborn, Octavius, and Dillon realize they were pulled from their universes just before their deaths.[b] Strange prepares to reverse the contained spell and send the villains back to their respective universes, but Peter argues that they should first cure the villains of the insanity that would lead to their deaths, to possibly change their fates upon their return. When Strange refuses, Peter steals the spell, traps Strange in the Mirror Dimension, and, with May, takes the villains to Happy Hogan''s apartment, where he uses Stark Industries technology to cure Octavius. Before Peter can cure anyone else, his spider-sense goes off. He then realizes that the Goblin persona has retaken control of Osborn, who convinces the uncured villains to betray Peter. As Dillon, Marko, and Connors escape, the Goblin fatally injures May. Before she dies, May tells Peter that "with great power, there must also come great responsibility".

Ned discovers that he can create portals using Strange''s sling ring, which he and MJ use to try to locate Peter. They instead find alternate versions of Peter from the villains'' universes who were also summoned by Strange''s spell and who are nicknamed "Peter-Two" and "Peter-Three". The group finds this universe''s Peter, nicknamed "Peter-One", who is ready to give up and send the villains home to die. The alternate Peters share stories of losing loved ones and encourage Peter-One to fight in May''s honor, and the three Peters develop cures for the villains.

The group lure Dillon, Marko, and Connors to the Statue of Liberty. Peter-One and Peter-Two cure Connors and Marko, while Octavius arrives to help cure Dillon, and Ned frees Strange from the Mirror Dimension. The Goblin appears and unleashes the contained spell, which breaks apart the barriers between universes, pulling in countless others who know Parker''s identity. Strange attempts to hold them off while an enraged Peter-One tries to kill the Goblin. Peter-Two stops him, but gets stabbed by the Goblin. Peter-Three helps Peter-One inject the Goblin with his cure, restoring Osborn''s sanity. Peter-One realizes that the only way to protect the multiverse is to erase himself from everyone''s memory and requests Strange to do so, while promising MJ and Ned that he will find them again. Strange reluctantly casts the spell, and everyone returns to their respective universes—including Eddie Brock,[c] who unknowingly leaves behind a piece of the Venom symbiote.

Two weeks later, Peter visits MJ to reintroduce himself to her and Ned, but he decides against it. While mourning at May''s grave, he has a conversation with Hogan and is inspired to carry on, making a new suit and resuming his vigilantism.

The shipment, consisting of multiple large wooden crates, is transported by locals from Romania. However, the locals refuse to load the cargo onto the ship, insisting that they must leave the area before sundown. One of them hands the quartermaster, Wojchek, and another crewman, Olgaren, a large sum of money and wishes the Demeter a safe voyage before departing with the others.

Clemens, a doctor educated at the University of Cambridge, overhears that the ship is looking for crewmen. He attempts to convince the crew that his medical skills and knowledge of astronomy would make him a valuable asset to them. Wojchek rejects him and hires an older man instead, but while helping to load one of the crates, the new hire – frightened upon recognizing the dragon emblem on its shorter side – accidentally releases the tackle rope, causing the crate to fall. Clemens witnesses the accident and saves Elliott''s grandson, Toby, from being crushed by the loose crate. The new hire declares the dragon emblem a bad omen and leaves; out of gratitude for Clemens'' intervention, Elliott hires him as a replacement.

One of the crates falls and breaks open in the cargo hold. Clemens investigates and finds a woman buried in dirt inside. She is barely alive, and he performs blood transfusions on her to treat what he believes to be an infection. Later in the Aegean Sea, Clemens and Olgaren see a mysterious figure in the fog on deck.

The next night, all the animals aboard the ship are killed, including the ship''s dog, Huckleberry. The crew, fearing a rabies outbreak, throws them all overboard. Anna, the secret stowaway, wakes up and warns them about a monster from Transylvania, a creature that feeds on the blood of humans. In her town they called it Dracula, to whom she was given as a slave of blood so that the monster would leave them alone. She claims that Dracula is already aboard the ship and looking to feed, which is when she reveals several bites from the beast on her body.

Dracula hunts the crew during the night, biting Olgaren and turning him into a vampiric thrall. Olgaren is restrained by being tied to a table. He breaks free one night, and seeing Toby in the hold, begins hunting him down and traps him in the captain''s quarters with Dracula. As the crew attempts to save him, Toby is bitten by Dracula. The next morning, the vampiric Olgaren, who has been tied to the mast by the crew, bursts into flames as the sun rises. Despite blood transfusions from his grandfather, Toby dies and is wrapped in sailcloth for his burial at sea. During the funeral, the captain believes he sees the body moving, and unwraps it only to see Toby open his eyes and attack him. The vampiric Toby catches fire in the sunlight, also severely burning his grandfather before Clemens is able to throw Toby into the ocean.

The remaining crew members decide to try to destroy the ship and drown Dracula to prevent him from wreaking havoc once they reach London. Captain Elliot, Abrams, and Wojchek are killed by Dracula, and Anna is bitten during an attempt to save Clemens. Clemens rescues Anna by hitting Dracula with an axe, and Anna manages to crush Dracula with a part of the mast. Anna and Clemens jump ship, thinking the vampire is doomed. However, before sinking, the ship ends up running aground on the British coast, at which point Dracula is able to push the mast from his body and roars in victory.

Anna and Clemens float away on wreckage from the ship. Anna reveals to Clemens that she is turning into a vampire as a result of Dracula''s bites, with Clemens'' blood transfusions only delaying her transformation. As morning approaches, not wanting to become a monster like Dracula, Anna willingly immolates herself in the sunlight before Clemens drifts ashore.

Arriving in London, Clemens goes to a local tavern where he draws Anna''s portrait in his notebook. He hears the knocking signal from the Demeter''s crew of "all clear," and then sees Dracula, dressed as an aristocrat, laughing at him. The vampire disappears. Leaving the premises, Clemens sees the vampire''s shadow and begins to follow him as he vows for the memory of his dead companions, that he will kill Dracula and send him back to Hell.

Following the death of Suyin Zhang, Jonas has been raising her teenaged daughter Meiying alongside her uncle and Suyin''s brother Jiuming Zhang, who has acquired his father''s company alongside wealthy financier Hillary Driscoll. Mana One has also been studying a female Meg called Haiqi, who was discovered as a pup and trained by Jiuming in a reserve in Hainan. Recently, Haiqi has been acting erratically, leading to Jonas being concerned despite Jiuming''s enthusiasm.

Jonas and Jiuming lead a routine submersible exploration to the Trench, with Meiying stowing away to see the trench for the first time. Fellow Meg survivors DJ and Mac observe the group from the Mana One. On their way down, the subs are pursued by Haiqi, who escaped captivity the previous night; the subs dive down through the thermocline to escape, but Haiqi forces her way through it anyway. Two much larger Megs, a massive alpha male and a slightly smaller beta male, appear and mate with Haiqi. While working on an escape plan, Jonas and his team discover an illegal mining operation in a station captained by the mercenary Montes, who has a vendetta against Jonas for his imprisonment some time before. Montes'' crew was hired by Driscoll to covertly use the Mana One''s access to the trench to farm rare earth minerals that could earn them billions. Montes kills his crew in an explosion to cover up their activities, which causes a rupture in the trench and grounds both Jonas’ and Jiuming''s ships.

DJ, Mac, and fellow Mana One analyst Jess discover that the rescue pod has been sabotaged, forcing the crew to use exosuits to walk towards the station in the creature-filled trench, with only Jonas, Meiying, Jiuming and security officer Rigas surviving the journey. Jess and Driscoll reveal themselves to be traitors and attempt to kill the four, but the four escape the station in another submersible after a scuffle with Montes, who escapes to the surface through a buoy. Driscoll sends mercenaries to take over the Mana One while Montes surfaces and meets with Jess. As the crew surfaces, they discover the rupture from earlier which leads to several of the creatures, including the three Megs, a swarm of lizard-like creatures known as Snappers and a giant octopus escaping the trench and reaching the surface.

Jonas’ crew meets with DJ and Mac, and Montes focuses the mercenaries on the crew after Jess is devoured by a Meg. Jonas’ team escapes to a nearby resort, Fun Island, to warn them of the approaching creatures. Driscoll, Montes and the mercenaries arrive at Fun Island to eliminate Jonas’ crew, but they are instead attacked by the Snappers, who kill Driscoll and several mercenaries. Jonas’ group splits up to evacuate the tourists as the Megs and the octopus begin their attack. Jonas manages to kill the beta male Meg using an explosive taped to a harpoon before being attacked by Montes, leading both to sail to the beach. The two battle before Jonas knocks Montes into the mouth of the alpha Meg to be consumed. Jiuming creates a bomb out of fertilizer and along with Mac takes over Driscoll''s unattended helicopter to fly towards the beach where Meiying is trying to help tourists.

The octopus takes down the helicopter and Jiuming injures it with his bomb, attracting Haiqi, who engages in a battle with the Octopus and proceeds to kill the beast. As Jiuming swims towards the wreckage to save Mac, Jonas picks up one of the helicopter''s rotors and uses it to fatally impale the alpha Meg through the head. Haiqi heads towards Jonas, Jiuming, and Mac, but Jiuming uses his training signals to divert her attention. Haiqi redirects her attention to a pod of dolphins swimming away. Making their way to the beach, Jiuming reasons that Haiqi escaped captivity because it was mating season, and discusses the possibility she is pregnant. Jonas decides that it is better not to think about it, and the group celebrate their survival.

After attempting to stage a revolt, a young slave boy is given the powers of Shazam by the Council of Wizards, transforming him into Kahndaq''s heroic champion. He kills Ahk-Ton, ending his reign.

In the present day, Kahndaq is oppressed by the Intergang, a criminal organization, as Adrianna Tomaz, an archaeologist, tries to locate the Crown of Sabbac with her brother Karim and colleagues Samir and Ishmael. Inside the tomb, Adrianna obtains the crown, but the Intergang troops kill Samir. As a last resort, she reads an incantation that awakens Teth-Adam from slumber. US government official Amanda Waller deems Adam a threat after he slaughters the Intergang troops, she contacts the Justice Society to apprehend him. Justice Society members Hawkman, Doctor Fate, Cyclone, and Atom Smasher stop Adam''s killing spree and explain to Adrianna that Adam was not a savior but an imprisoned killer.

Ishmael reveals himself as the leader of Intergang''s Kahndaq division and kidnaps Adrianna''s son Amon, who has hidden the crown. Ishmael reveals himself to be the last descendant of Ahk-Ton. The group finds the crown and gives it back to save Amon. Ishmael attempts to shoot Amon, causing Adam to lose control, killing Ishmael and wounding Amon.

Guilt-ridden, Adam flees and reveals to Hawkman that it was Adam''s son, Hurut, who was granted Shazam''s powers. Knowing that Hurut was invincible, Ahk-Ton instructed assassins to execute Hurut''s family. Hurut gave his father his powers to save his life and Ahk-Ton''s assassins immediately killed the de-powered Hurut, causing an enraged Adam to massacre the king''s men and destroy his palace. Deemed unworthy by the Council of Wizards, Adam killed them all in anger except for Shazam, who imprisoned him along with the Crown of Sabbac.

Feeling incapable of becoming a true hero, Adam surrenders and the Justice Society takes him to a secret underwater Task Force X black site in Antarctica, where Emilia Harcourt places him in stasis. Fate again has a premonition of Hawkman''s impending death. The Justice Society realizes Ishmael intentionally provoked Adam to kill him in order to be reborn as Sabbac, the champion of the six eponymous demons.

When Sabbac summons the Legions of Hell to terrorize Kahndaq, the Justice Society unsuccessfully attempts to stop Sabbac. Fate believes that Hawkman''s death can be avoided with his sacrifice and fights Sabbac alone. Fate uses astral projection to release Adam before he is killed by Sabbac. Meanwhile, Amon, Adrianna, and Karim rally the people to fight the Legions of Hell. Sabbac overpowers Hawkman, but Adam arrives in time to kill Sabbac, causing the Legions of Hell to disappear. The Justice Society departs on good terms with Adam, who destroys the old throne in the belief that Kahndaq needs a protector, not a ruler. He adopts a new name: Black Adam.

Following the events at Saint Cartha''s monastery, Sister Irene now serves in a convent in Italy. Maurice works at a boarding school in France, where he has befriended a young Irish student named Sophie and her teacher and mother, Kate. Irene has a vision of Maurice asking her to save him. She is dispatched by the Cardinal to investigate a series of deaths across Europe, attributed to the demon Valak, due to her previous experience with the demon. She travels to Tarascon with Sister Debra, a young novice who expresses her difficulty in accepting miracles, such as the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Meanwhile, a delivery girl witnesses Valak talking to a possessed Maurice before Valak kills her.

In Tarascon, Irene is haunted by Valak and has a strange vision. Debra tells Irene that she received Noiret''s rosary from Jacques. At school, Sophie is bullied by classmates and locked in the deconsecrated sealed-off chapel. The bully points out the goat on the stained-glass window, claiming the devil appears when the sun shines through and turns the goat''s eyes red. One night, the headmistress encounters a sleepwalking Maurice and is killed by Valak in the guise of her deceased son.

Irene and Debra travel to the Palais des Papes and meet with a librarian. He explains that Valak was an angel rejected by God and the emblem on Noiret''s rosary is the family crest of St. Lucy, who was martyred by a pagan. Though she was set on fire, she miraculously did not burn; her eyes were gouged out, but her family recovered them. The librarian suggests the demon is killing St. Lucy''s descendants because it wants this powerful relic, last known to be stored in a former monastery-turned-winery. The winery then became the present-day boarding school.

At the school, Irene and Debra face off against a fully possessed Maurice. Sophie shows the women the stained-glass goat in the chapel and they use a flashlight to make its eyes glow red. The red light acts as a laser, pointing to where the eyes of St. Lucy are buried. Irene finds the relic and the stained-glass goat vanishes, reappearing in real life as a demonic creature.

As the goat attacks the students, Maurice attacks Irene, chases Sophie, and causes the bell tower to collapse. Debra admits to Irene that she now has faith. Irene uses the relic against Maurice, but he grabs it, causing Valak to appear. Similar to Father Noiret, Valak lifts Irene in the air and sets her ablaze. Irene surprisingly does not burn and subsequently realizes she is a descendant of St. Lucy, able to harness the same power associated with the relic. Irene and Debra pray the Words of Institution used in Christian celebrations of the Eucharist and the old barrels of wine in the room become the blood of Christ from their belief. As the blood soaks Valak, the demon is damned back to Hell.

The next morning, Irene meets with Maurice, who is seemingly cured. However, she becomes concerned as she watches him leaving with Sophie and Kate.', '1956 - France. A priest is murdered.

The aspects of five most important "core memories" within her personality incorporate the form of five floating islands. Joy acts as the leader, and she tries to limit Sadness''s influence; Joy sees purpose in Fear, Disgust, and Anger, but thinks Sadness makes everything worse.

At the age of 11, Riley moves from Minnesota to San Francisco for her father''s new job. At first, she has poor experiences: the new house is cramped and old; her father hardly has any time for her due to him needing to set up his new job; a local pizza parlor only serves pizza topped with broccoli, which she dislikes; and the moving van with their belongings was misdirected to Texas and will not arrive for weeks. On Riley''s first day at her new school, Sadness retroactively turns joyous memories sad, which causes Riley to cry in front of her class and creates a sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of it by using a vacuum tube, but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, disabling the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters.

Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong''s chant-fueled wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump.

Maui, the trickster, shape-shifting Demigod of the wind and sea and master of wayfinding, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation. This causes Te Fiti to disintegrate, and Maui is attacked by Te Kā, a volcanic demon. He loses both the heart and his magic fish hook to the depths of the sea.

A thousand years later, the ocean chooses Moana, daughter of Motunui''s chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui and Sina, Moana''s father and mother, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her to become the island''s chief. Sixteen years later, blight strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island''s reef with her pet pig Pua to find more fish and find out what is happening, but Tui forbids it. Moana tries conquering the reef but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked. That afternoon, Moana''s grandmother Tala shows her a secret cavern of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti''s heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains that Te Kā''s darkness is destroying the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and has him restore the heart of Te Fiti. Having been given the heart by the ocean, Tala gives it to Moana. Tala later gets severely sick, and on her deathbed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.

Moana sets sail on a camakau from the cavern along with her dimwitted pet rooster, Heihei, who has stowed away on it. They are caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands that Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave before leaving on her boat. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora, coconut pirates who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to retrieve his magical fishhook in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant coconut crab. While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook, only to find himself unable to control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana''s quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents abandoned him as an infant, and the gods, taking pity on him, granted him his powers. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of way-finding, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.

They arrive at Te Fiti''s island, only to be attacked by Te Kā. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui''s hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook again, Maui abandons Moana, who asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart and loses hope. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala''s spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. She retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te Kā. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te Kā, destroying his hook in the process. Upon being unable to find Te Fiti, Moana realizes Te Kā is Te Fiti, corrupted without her heart. The ocean clears a path for Moana, allowing her to return the heart to Te Fiti, who heals the ocean and islands of blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who fixes his hook as well as Moana''s boat before falling into a deep sleep and becoming an island.

An old woman named Mother Gothel hid the flower and used it to retain her youth and beauty. Centuries later, the flower was taken by soldiers from the nearby kingdom of Corona and used to save their pregnant and ailing Queen, who gave birth to a daughter with golden hair, named Rapunzel. Gothel snuck into the castle and discovered that Rapunzel’s hair had inherited the flower''s magic, but turns brown and powerless when cut. To keep the flower''s magic, Gothel kidnapped Rapunzel and now raises her in a hidden tower in the woods. Each year on their daughter''s birthday, the king and queen release sky lanterns, hoping they will guide her home.

Eighteen years later, Rapunzel, with an overprotective chameleon named Pascal, is fascinated by the annual lights and, on the eve of her 18th birthday, asks for permission to leave the tower and investigate them. Gothel refuses, saying the outside world is too dangerous for her. Meanwhile, thief Flynn Rider steals Rapunzel''s intended crown from the palace; he abandons the Stabbington brothers, his partners, while being relentlessly pursued by royal guard-horse Maximus ("Max"). Flynn discovers and takes refuge in the tower, where Rapunzel knocks him out with a frying pan and hides him in a closet. When Rapunzel attempts to show him to Gothel as proof she can defend herself, Gothel angrily berates Rapunzel and again refuses to let her leave the tower. Hatching a plan, Rapunzel instead asks for new paint as a gift, sending Gothel on a three-day journey.

Rapunzel hides the crown and strikes a deal with Flynn, promising to return it in exchange for taking her to see the lanterns. Along the way, they stop at the Snuggly Duckling pub. Menacing thugs try to capture the wanted Flynn, but Rapunzel charms them into revealing their softer sides. When royal guards arrive, the thugs help her and Flynn escape. Meanwhile, Gothel becomes suspicious, returns to the now empty tower, and finds the crown. She sets out to find Rapunzel and allies with the Stabbington brothers.

Flynn and Rapunzel become trapped in a fast-flooding cave; believing they will suffocate, Flynn reveals his true name, Eugene Fitzherbert. Rapunzel uses the magic glow of her hair to reveal a hidden exit beneath the water, and they escape. That night, Gothel confronts Rapunzel alone and gives her the crown, telling her to test Eugene''s loyalty.

The next morning, Max tracks down Eugene and attempts to arrest him, but Rapunzel demands a birthday truce, which Max reluctantly agrees to. Rapunzel and Eugene enter the kingdom and attend a festival in honor of the "lost princess". After a day of celebration, they sail onto the lake to watch the release of the lanterns. Having fulfilled her dream, Rapunzel gives Eugene the crown, and they confess their love. When Eugene sees the Stabbington brothers on the shore, he goes to apologize and offers them the crown. Instead, the brothers tie him to a ship with the crown, tricking Rapunzel into thinking he abandoned her. They try to capture Rapunzel, but Gothel stages a rescue by knocking them out, and takes the heartbroken Rapunzel back to the tower.

Eugene is arrested but escapes with the help of Max and the pub thugs. Meanwhile, Rapunzel realizes she has subconsciously incorporated the kingdom''s standard, a golden sun, into her artwork throughout her life. Realizing that she is the "lost princess", she confronts Gothel, from whom she realizes she should have been hiding all along, and says she will never allow Gothel to use her hair again. Eugene arrives at the tower and calls to Rapunzel. Her hair is lowered to him, but upon climbing up, he finds her bound and gagged, and Gothel fatally stabs him from behind. Gothel attempts to drag Rapunzel away, but Rapunzel angrily resists, assuring Gothel that she will never stop trying to get away from her. However, Rapunzel promises to go willingly if allowed to heal Eugene. Gothel reluctantly agrees to this, but Eugene, realizing Rapunzel would spend the rest of her life in captivity, cuts off her hair before she can heal him. A horrified and infuriated Gothel suddenly ages rapidly, then falls from the tower and turns to dust.

One evening, Wreck-It Ralph, the villain of platform game Fix-it Felix, Jr., visits a villain support group called Bad-Anon, expressing frustration with his assigned role. When Ralph is excluded and ostracized from his game''s 30th-anniversary party, he decides to win a medal and earn respect. Upon overhearing that one can earn medals in a first-person shooter called Hero''s Duty, Ralph sneaks in and steals one while the characters fight insectoid monsters known as Cy-Bugs. Ralph accidentally launches himself in an escape shuttle with a Cy-Bug inside and crash-lands in the confectionery-themed kart racing game Sugar Rush. With Ralph gone, his game is labeled "out of order" and put in danger of being unplugged. Fix-It Felix, Jr, the hero, leaves the game to find Ralph, allying with Sergeant Calhoun, the heroine of Hero''s Duty. Calhoun is tracking the Cy-Bug, as Cy-Bugs behave as a virus once outside their game. Felix worries Ralph will meet the same fate as Turbo, the protagonist of the racing game TurboTime, who became jealous of a newly-installed RoadBlasters cabinet''s success and tried to take it over, resulting in both games being unplugged.

In Sugar Rush, a girl named Vanellope von Schweetz steals Ralph''s medal and uses it to buy her way into the nightly race that determines which characters will be playable the next day. King Candy, the ruler of Sugar Rush''s world, forbids her to race, as she is a glitch that teleports erratically. Vanellope promises to get the medal back if Ralph helps her win; he helps her build a new kart and teaches her to drive inside Diet Cola Mountain. Meanwhile, Calhoun and Felix arrive in Sugar Rush, where they fall into "Nesquik-sand", work together to escape, and begin to fall in love.

King Candy hacks into Sugar Rush''s source code and retrieves the medal, giving it back to Ralph. He claims that if Vanellope becomes a playable character, her glitching may lead to Sugar Rush being labeled out of order and unplugged. Ralph decides he cannot allow Vanellope to race, and he destroys her kart. Calhoun abandons Felix when he inadvertently reminds her of her late fiancé, who was killed by a Cy-Bug during their wedding; Felix is imprisoned by King Candy''s assistant, Sour Bill, while Calhoun discovers that the Cy-Bug has multiplied exponentially.

A despondent Ralph returns to Fix-it Felix, Jr., but the game has been evacuated. Ralph notices that the Sugar Rush cabinet displays Vanellope as an actual playable character. Realizing King Candy''s deception, Ralph returns to Sugar Rush and interrogates Sour Bill, learning that King Candy damaged Vanellope''s code. King Candy''s edits to the code also have ensured no one but himself knows Vanellope''s true role. However, if Vanellope completes a race, all of King Candy''s changes will be deleted, as the game will reset itself. Ralph reconciles with and frees Vanellope and Felix from prison. Felix fixes the kart, and Vanellope belatedly enters the race, just before the Cy-Bugs emerge and start destroying the game. Calhoun, Felix, and Ralph help evacuate the characters.

Unaware of this development, King Candy attempts to ram Vanellope off the track, causing them both to glitch. Their glitching inadvertently reveals King Candy to be Turbo, who secretly took over Sugar Rush after surviving the unplugging of TurboTime. Vanellope flees as Turbo is devoured by a Cy-Bug, which fuses with him into an insectoid monster. Everyone but Vanellope evacuates, as glitches cannot leave their games. Remembering from Hero''s Duty that a beacon will draw and destroy the Cy-Bugs, Ralph battles Turbo and collapses the Mentos roof of Diet Cola Mountain, creating a glowing eruption that lures and destroys Turbo and the Cy-Bugs. Vanellope rescues Ralph and crosses the finish line. The game resets, revealing her as the true ruler of Sugar Rush, though she keeps her glitching ability, considering it an advantage.

The rats live in an elderly woman''s attic outside Paris, but when the woman discovers them, they are forced to evacuate, and Remy is separated from the others. Encouraged by an imaginary Gusteau, he explores until he finds himself on the roof of Gusteau''s restaurant.

Remy notices the restaurant''s new garbage boy, Alfredo Linguini, attempting to fix a soup he ruined, and jumps in to fix Linguini''s mistakes. Linguini catches Remy in the act, but does not reveal him to Skinner, Gusteau''s former sous-chef and the new owner of the restaurant. Skinner confronts Linguini for tampering with the soup, but when the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success, Colette Tatou, the restaurant''s only female chef, convinces Skinner to retain Linguini and uphold Gusteau''s motto, "Anyone can cook". After demanding that Linguini replicate the soup, Skinner spots Remy and orders Linguini to take him outside and kill him.

After Remy tells Django that he intends to stay at the restaurant, Django shows him a group of exterminated rats in an attempt to convince him that humans are dangerous, but Remy ignores his warnings and leaves.

Meanwhile, Skinner discovers through a letter from Linguini''s late mother that Linguini is Gusteau''s illegitimate son, and the rightful owner of the restaurant. Skinner is shocked and enraged about this revelation, as Gusteau''s will stated that he would inherit ownership of the restaurant, only if no biological heir appeared two years prior to the latter''s death. After his lawyer verifies that Linguini is Gusteau''s heir, Skinner hides the evidence in an envelope, but Remy finds it and runs away, showing the documents to Linguini, who then forces Skinner out. The restaurant thrives as Remy''s recipes become popular, and Linguini''s life improves as he develops a romantic relationship with Colette. Food critic Anton Ego, whose previous negative review of the restaurant indirectly led to Gusteau''s death, announces to Linguini that he will dine at the restaurant. After Linguini takes credit for Remy''s cooking at a press conference, he and Remy have a falling out. As revenge, Remy leads his clan to raid the restaurant''s pantries for food. Linguini arrives to apologize, but upon discovering the raid, he furiously kicks Remy and the other rats out.

Grand Pabbie warns Elsa that she must learn to control her powers, and that fear will be her enemy. The sisters are isolated within the castle, the gates of which are now closed off to the public. Out of fear of her increasingly unpredictable powers, Elsa ceases all contact with Anna, causing them to become emotionally distant. When the sisters are teenagers, the King and Queen are lost at sea and presumed dead.

At the age of 21, Elsa is due to be crowned queen, but fears that her subjects will discover her magic and fear her. The castle gates are opened for the first time in years to the public and visiting dignitaries, including the scheming Duke of Weselton and the handsome Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Elsa''s coronation proceeds without incident, but she remains distant from Anna. Anna and Hans develop a romantic connection during the festivities, and he impulsively proposes to her, but Elsa objects when they seek her blessing.

One of the rebellion''s leaders, Min Seung-ho, challenges him to a duel, during which Tae-yul''s sword shatters and shards of metal pierce his eyes. The King personally stops the duel, declaring he will abdicate the throne, and releases Tae-yul from his service.

Years later, an older Tae-yul now lives with his teenage daughter, Tae-ok. The two live and work as trappers, but Tae-ok is increasingly frustrated with her father''s refusal to let her experience life outside of their home in the mountains; Tae-yul retorts the world is far more dangerous than she understands and he only wants to protect her. Tae-yul''s injuries have grown worse, and a local monk warns Tae-ok that unless his eyes are treated with special herbs, he will go completely blind in a few days. The monk sends them to the trader Hwa Seon, but Seon reveals the herbs are both too expensive and only available to those with political connections.

The Joseon royal court receives a visit from Gurutai, a relative of the Qing emperor who has enriched himself by enslaving and selling captives taken during the recent Qing invasion of Joseon. With their nation already suffering under the corrupt rule of the Qing, the King and his advisors fear Gurutai will soon force them to hand over their own children as "tributes" to Qing nobles. Lee Mok-yo, a respected member of the court, decides to write a petition to the King to start openly resisting the Qing and their demands. He also makes a request to Seon for help finding a young girl to care for his aging mother; Seon recommends Tae-ok, who is excited both at the prospect of being adopted by a wealthy family and earning the herbs her father needs.

Gurutai''s men harass Seon and her workers, and Tae-yul, using only his cane, fights them off when they threaten Tae-ok. That evening, Tae-ok leaves for Lee''s estate, where Gurutai and his personal retinue of assassins soon carry out an ambush, killing all of Lee''s servants and taking his daughter and Tae-ok as hostages. Tae-yul learns about his daughter''s kidnapping when he survives an attempt on his life, then saves Seon from a retaliatory attack by a Qing slaver. He locates the main slave camp used by Gurutai and burns it to the ground after butchering the guards and freeing those held captive inside. A lone survivor agrees to lead him to Gurutai''s private compound.

Lee, leading a force of royal guardsmen, tries to rescue his daughter but instead watches helplessly as his men are gunned down by Qing riflemen. Tae-yul shows up and kills not only the entire company of riflemen but Gurutai''s assassins as well. He finally collapses from exhaustion, and is rescued by Lee and Seon, who administer the herbs. Seon admits to Tae-yul he will still go blind anyway, at which point he won''t be able to fight. With little time remaining, Tae-yul confronts Min, now employed by Gurutai after betraying Lee out of disgust for his self-serving ways.

After a brief duel, Tae-yul forces Min to yield, at which point Gurutai slits his throat for losing. The two men face each other in a final battle, with Gurutai ordering his mistress to hold Tae-ok at knifepoint and a Qing envoy observing the duel. Gurutai initially has the upper hand, but Tae-yul manages to stab his mistress through the neck, saving Tae-ok, before disarming and impaling Gurutai with his sword. The envoy stops his guards from interfering, allowing Tae-ok and the other slaves to go free. Tae-yul embraces his daughter as he slowly goes completely blind.

A flashback reveals Tae-ok is not Tae-yul''s biological daughter, but rather the only child of King Gwanghaegun; the King tasked Tae-yul with raising her as his own child so he would have a reason to live. The movie ends with Tae-yul and Tae-ok slowly making their way down the mountain, with Tae-yul declaring he''s ready to see the rest of the world.

Before the train departs, an ill woman runs onto the train unnoticed. She turns into a zombie and attacks a train attendant, who also turns. The infection spreads rapidly throughout the train.

The group escapes to another car and locks the doors. Internet reports and phone calls make it known that an epidemic is spreading southward across the country. When the train stops at Daejeon Station, the survivors find the city overrun by zombies and hastily retreat back to the train, splitting up into different train cars in the ensuing chaos.

The orphaned Bruce is raised by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth.

Fourteen years later, Chill is paroled after testifying against mafia boss Carmine Falcone. Bruce intends to murder Chill to avenge his parents, but one of Falcone''s assassins does so first. Bruce''s childhood friend Rachel Dawes berates him for acting outside the justice system. After confronting Falcone, who says that real power comes from being feared, Bruce spends the next seven years traveling the world, training in combat and immersing himself in the criminal underworld.

In a Bhutan prison, he is approached by Henri Ducard, who recruits him to the League of Shadows, led by Ra''s al Ghul. The League believes Gotham is beyond saving and intends to destroy it. After completing his training, Bruce rejects the League and its mandate that killing is necessary, burning down their temple during his escape. Ra''s is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious Ducard. Intent on fighting crime, Bruce returns to Gotham and takes an interest in his family''s company, Wayne Enterprises, which is being taken public by businessman William Earle.

Intercepting a drug shipment, Batman provides Rachel, now a Gotham Assistant District Attorney, with evidence against Falcone and enlists Sergeant James Gordon, one of Gotham''s few honest police officers, to arrest him. In prison, Falcone meets Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychologist whom he has helped smuggle drugs into Gotham. Donning a scarecrow mask, Crane sprays Falcone with a fear-inducing hallucinogen, which drives him insane and has him transferred to Arkham Asylum. While investigating his crimes, Batman is sprayed with the hallucinogen and set on fire by Crane. Batman manages to escape and is saved by Alfred, who gives him an antidote for the hallucinogen developed by Fox.

The officer in charge tells Hanne Lindberg, Head of the Cyber Division of Europol, that Benjamin asked to conduct the interrogation. Benjamin says that he has information regarding FR13NDS (/frɛndz/), a notorious hacking group of four members connected to the Russian cyber mafia, and MRX, an infamous hacker known on Darknet; he tells her that he could give them both to Hanne if she listens to him. Having no choice, Hanne sits down.

Benjamin tells Hanne that he is like a superhero: like many heroes, he, too, has no parents; he never met his father as he abandoned the family when Benjamin was born, and his mother committed suicide when he was 8. He lives alone with his ailing grandmother. He regards his "superpower" as invisibility, as he was never noticed by most people during his childhood, due to him being socially awkward. He says he learned programming and hacked his first system when he was 14. Though he felt like a loser in real life, he felt a sense of belonging on the Internet. While spending most of his time on Darknet, he met his hacking hero, MRX, whose identity no one knows and who can hack into any system. Benjamin aspires to be like him.

However, as he was unable to attend university, he worked as a pizza delivery boy to pay the bills. He tells Hanne that, one night while he delivered pizzas to a group of students, he saw Marie, a girl with whom he was in love since his school days. Hearing her having trouble with examinations, he decided to help her and be a ''superhero''. He went to the University, hacked into its servers to download the exam questions—but he was caught by a security guard and arrested. Having no prior criminal record, he was forced to perform community service as a punishment.

He tells Hanne that while working on cleaning the streets as punishment, he met Max, a fellow hacker, who Benjamin feels is the opposite of himself; a charismatic, cocky and confident individual. Later, Max had introduced him to his colleagues Stephan and Paul. After Benjamin proved himself as a hacker, Max explained to him that the concept of social engineering is the greatest form of hacking. They decide to form a hacking group, called "Clowns Laughing At You", nicknamed CLAY, and they use Benjamin''s house as a base of operations, since Benjamin was forced to send his grandmother to a nursing home due to her Alzheimer''s disease. They cause general mayhem around Berlin in a form of pranking, becoming popular around social media. However, MRX, with whom is Max obsessed, mocks them outright. Infuriated, Max wants to perform a more outrageous feat of hacking, and Benjamin suggest hacking the main building of BND (German Central Intelligence). Impressed by this outrageous idea, the group agrees with Benjamin and decide to hack the BND in order to impress MRX.

Using dumpster diving and phishing to gain access to the BND building, they manage to hack the internal servers and hack the printers to print their logo, titled "NO SYSTEM IS SAFE", all around the building, impressing MRX. However, when they go to a club and celebrate, Benjamin notices Max kissing Marie. Infuriated, Benjamin refuses to let them into the house, also offending Marie when she visits him due to his anger. Feeling inferior, he secretly contacts MRX, offering him valuable information: a database from BND''s private servers, which he hacked while he was in the BND building, which impresses MRX. When the group arrives the next day, Benjamin is still furious and attacks Max, who responds by beating him up. However, Paul, watching the TV, hears on the news that one of the members of FR13NDS, nicknamed Krypton, was murdered. Benjamin admits that he gave the information from the BND to MRX, and after checking them, realizes that the information identified Krypton as a double agent working with Hanne to expose MRX and FR13NDS, and CLAY is now labeled as a terrorist group for hacking the information.

Seeking to clear their name for the murder, Benjamin contacts MRX, who instructs them to hack into the Europol database in exchange for MRX''s identity, giving them a hacking tool to help. After dissolving their hard drives in acid to erase data, they travel to Europol''s headquarters in The Hague in order to try and break their way in—but it''s impossible to find a way inside. The headquarters dump their trash in a secured building, the sewers are locked, and phishing attempts failed. However, while checking out the building, Benjamin notices a group of scholars visiting the building, and one of them drops his visitor card. Using Max''s advice about social engineering, Benjamin manages to gain access to the building by fooling a guard and plants a hacking device inside. He then hacks into the internal Europol servers and provides MRX with an entrance, secretly encoded inside a double trojan horse so MRX will be exposed when he tries to gain access. However, MRX, anticipating this, takes a snapshot of Benjamin via his webcam, exposing him. Benjamin is forced to flee when a group of Russian mobsters finds him; he evades them in the subway.

Benjamin returns to the hotel where he was staying with the trio, only to find them murdered. Having no other choice and knowing that FRI3NDS would kill him, he decided to turn himself in to Hanne, proving that he is serious after stating that he hacked her profile and learned personal information about her. Hanne, who was suspended for her failure to capture them and is desperate to apprehend FRI3NDS and MRX, agrees to put Benjamin into a witness protection program in exchange for capturing them. Benjamin logs in as MRX himself and spreads lies about MRX being a snitch, forcing the real MRX to force his way into the Darknet servers with unsafe methods, allowing Benjamin to expose him. MRX is exposed as a 19-year-old American boy from New York City, whom the FBI arrests in a coffee shop.

However, after agreeing to give Benjamin the witness exchange program, Hanne notices a wound going through his palm (the same wound that Max got after running a nail through his hand), and realizes that Max, Stephan and Paul are all made-up characters. Distraught, she visits Benjamin''s doctor, who states that his mother had multiple personality disorder and committed suicide because of it, learning that it can be genetically inherited. Hanne connects various plot holes in Benjamin''s story and realizes that "he" alone was CLAY; he committed all the atrocities, he hacked into the BND alone, and he planted the WWII bullets from his grandmother in the hotel to make it look like they were killed, imagining the trio due to his illness. Hanne confronts Benjamin, who has an emotional breakdown, as people with mental disorders cannot be given witness protection. However, Hanne changes her mind and allows him access to the witness protection program, revealed to be an "actual" program containing information about all citizens of Germany; Benjamin changes his identity here. Hanne, dropping Benjamin off, states that she let him go because he truly wants to stay invisible, and lets him go on the condition that he never hacks again.

Benjamin, now sporting blonde hair, is standing alone on a Scandlines ferry heading north. However, he is suddenly joined by Marie, Max, Stephan and Paul. In narration, Benjamin states that he performed "the greatest social engineering hack" ever; the scene shifts back to Benjamin going back to the hotel, finding the guys alive and well; he instructs them to flee since MRX knows his identity, but they refuse to leave him behind. After Marie visits them and confirms that mentally ill subjects cannot be granted witness protection, they devise a plan for Benjamin to go to Hanne and dictate the story, deliberately giving plot holes which she will most likely decipher, and then using her grief for him to give him access to the witness protection program, and also spiking his hand with a nail to make the story seem truthful. In the server room, it was revealed that Benjamin didn''t change his identity, he "erased" it completely. Benjamin states that Hanne will eventually realize his deception, but she won''t hunt him down as she got what she wanted.

Computer programmer Thomas Anderson, known by his hacking alias "Neo", is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase "the Matrix". Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named Morpheus has the answers Neo seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by Agent Smith, arrives at Neo''s workplace in search of him. Though Morpheus attempts to guide Neo to safety, Neo surrenders rather than risk a dangerous escape. The Agents offer to erase Neo''s criminal record in exchange for his help with locating Morpheus, who they claim is a terrorist. When Neo refuses to cooperate, they fuse his mouth shut, pin him down, and implant a robotic "bug" in his abdomen. Neo wakes up from what he believes to be a nightmare. Soon after, Neo is taken by Trinity to meet Morpheus, and she removes the bug from Neo.

Morpheus offers Neo a choice between two pills: red to reveal the truth about the Matrix, or blue to make Neo forget everything and return to his former life. Neo takes the red pill, and his reality begins to distort, awakening in a liquid-filled pod among countless other pods, containing other humans. He is then brought aboard Morpheus''s flying ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the situation: In the early 21st century, a war broke out between humanity and intelligent machines. After humans blocked the machines'' access to solar energy, the machines responded by enslaving humankind and harvesting their bioelectric power while keeping their minds pacified in the Matrix, a shared simulated reality modeled on the world as it was in 1999. In the years following, the remaining free humans took refuge in the underground city of Zion.

Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to "unplug" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix''s simulated nature allows them to bend its physical laws. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix kills the physical body too and explains that the Agents are sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels eliminate rebels in the real world. Neo''s prowess during virtual training cements Morpheus''s belief that Neo is "the One", a human prophesied to free humankind. The group enters the Matrix to visit the Oracle, a prophet-like program who predicted that the One would emerge. She implies to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus''s life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix, Agents and police ambush the group, tipped off by Cypher, a disgruntled crew member who has betrayed Morpheus in exchange for a deal to be plugged back into the Matrix to live a comfortable life.

To buy time for the others, Morpheus fights Smith and is captured. Cypher exits the Matrix and murders the other crew members as they lie unconscious. Before Cypher can kill Neo and Trinity, crew member Tank regains consciousness and kills him before pulling Neo and Trinity from the Matrix. The Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion, which would allow them to destroy it. Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as the Oracle prophesied; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to those of the Agents.

After Morpheus and Trinity safely exit the Matrix, Smith ambushes and appears to kill Neo. While a group of Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar, Trinity confesses her love for Neo and says the Oracle told her she would fall in love with the One. Neo is revived, with newfound abilities to perceive and control the Matrix; he easily defeats Smith, prompting the other Agents to flee and he leaves the Matrix just as the ship''s electromagnetic pulse disables the Sentinels.

In 2004, Snowden is undergoing basic training, having enlisted in the U.S. Army with intentions of matriculating to the Special Forces. He eventually fractures his tibia and is informed that he will be receiving an administrative discharge in the process.

Snowden applies for a position at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and subsequently undergoes the screening process. Initially, his answers to the screening questions are insufficient, but Deputy Director Corbin O''Brian decides to take a chance on him, given the demands of such extraordinary times. Snowden is then brought to "The Hill" where he is educated and tested on cyberwarfare. He learns about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which circumvents the Fourth Amendment rights of U.S. citizens by allowing warrant requests to be approved by a panel of judges that were appointed by the Chief Justice.

Snowden later takes a position with the NSA in Japan, initially under the pretense of building a program that would allow the government to back up all critical data from the Middle East in an emergency, a program which he names "Epic Shelter". Snowden learns of the practices the NSA and other U.S. government agencies are using not just in Japan, but in most countries which the U.S. is currently allied with, which include planting malware in different computers that manage government, infrastructure and financial sectors so that, in the event that any allies turn against the US, that country can effectively be shut down in retaliation. The stress associated with the job results in the end of his relationship with Mills, who moves back with her family in Maryland.

After Snowden is diagnosed with epilepsy, Mills agrees that he should join the operation for she believes the environment in Hawaii may be beneficial for his health. Upon beginning his new job in "The Tunnel", an underground World War II bunker that has been re-purposed for massive electronic surveillance and SIGINT operations, Snowden learns that Epic Shelter is actually providing real-time data that assists U.S. drone pilots in launching lethal strikes against terror suspects in Pakistan.

Snowden ultimately becomes disillusioned with what he is a part of. It culminates in Snowden smuggling a microSD card into his office by way of a Rubik''s Cube, and loading all relevant data. He then tells his colleagues he is feeling ill and departs. He advises Mills to fly home to Maryland, after which he contacts Poitras and Greenwald to schedule the meeting.

With the help of journalist Ewen MacAskill, the information is disseminated to the press on June 5, 2013, with additional leaks published in the following days. In the aftermath, with the help of MacAskill, Greenwald and Poitras, Snowden is smuggled out of Hong Kong on a flight bound for Latin America by way of Russia. However, the U.S. government revokes his passport, forcing him to remain in Moscow indefinitely. He is eventually granted asylum for three years, with Mills joining him at a later date.

He meets fellow math and science graduate students Sol, Ainsley, and Bender, as well as his roommate Charles Herman, a literature student.

Determined to publish his own original idea, Nash is inspired when he and his classmates discuss how to approach a group of women at a bar. Hansen quotes Adam Smith advocating "every man for himself", but Nash argues that a cooperative approach would lead to better chances of success in developing a new concept of governing dynamics. Publishing an article on his theory, he earns an appointment at MIT where he chooses Sol and Bender over Hansen to join him.

In 1953, Nash is invited to the Pentagon to study encrypted enemy telecommunications, which he deciphers mentally. Bored with his regular duties at MIT, including teaching, he is recruited by the mysterious William Parcher of the United States Department of Defense with a classified assignment: to look for hidden patterns in magazines and newspapers to thwart a Soviet plot. Nash becomes increasingly obsessive in his search for these patterns, delivering his results to a secret mailbox, and comes to believe he is being followed.

One of his students, Alicia Larde, asks him to dinner, and they fall in love. On a return visit to Princeton, Nash runs into Charles and his niece, Marcee. With Charles'' encouragement, he proposes to Alicia and they marry. Nash fears for his life after surviving a shootout between Parcher and Soviet agents, and learns Alicia is pregnant, but he is forced to continue his assignment. While delivering a guest lecture at Harvard University, Nash tries to flee from people he thinks are Soviet agents, led by a psychiatrist named Dr. Rosen, but is forcibly sedated and committed to a psychiatric facility.

Dr. Rosen tells Alicia that Nash has schizophrenia and that Charles, Marcee, and Parcher exist only in his imagination. Alicia backs up the doctor, telling Nash that no "William Parcher" is in the Defense Department and takes out the unopened documents he delivered to the secret mailbox. Nash is given a course of insulin shock therapy and eventually released. Frustrated with the side effects of his antipsychotic medication, he secretly stops taking it and starts seeing Parcher and Charles again.

In 1956, Alicia discovers Nash has resumed his "assignment" in a shed near their home. Realizing he has relapsed, Alicia rushes to the house to find Nash had left their infant son in the running bathtub, believing "Charles" was watching the baby. Alicia calls Dr. Rosen, but Nash accidentally knocks her and the baby to the ground, believing he''s fighting Parcher.

As Alicia flees with the baby, Nash fights with his visions and realizes that all of them have looked the same ever since he first saw them. He stops Alicia''s car and tells her he realizes that "Marcee" isn''t real because she doesn''t age, finally accepting that Parcher and other figures are hallucinations. Against Dr. Rosen''s advice, Nash chooses not to restart his medication, believing he can deal with his symptoms himself, and Alicia decides to stay and support him.

Nash returns to Princeton, approaching his old rival Hansen, now head of the mathematics department, who allows him to work out of the library and audit classes. Over the next two decades, Nash learns to ignore his hallucinations and, by the late 1970s, is allowed to teach again.

In 1994, Nash is awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his revolutionary work on game theory, and is honored by his fellow professors. At the ceremony, he dedicates the prize to his wife. As Nash, Alicia, and their son leave the auditorium in Stockholm, Nash sees Charles, Marcee, and Parcher watching him, but merely glances at them before departing.', 'The handsome and arrogant John Forbes Nash Jr. found himself on a painful and harrowing journey of self-discovery.', 'beautiful_mind.jpg'),

Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that his own son, Commodus, is unfit to rule and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to restore Rome''s republic. Marcus Aurelius informs Commodus of his decision; in response, Commodus murders his father.

Commodus proclaims himself the new emperor and requests loyalty from Maximus, who refuses. Maximus is arrested by the Praetorian Guard and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and, wounded, rides for his home near Turgalium, where he finds his wife and son crucified. Maximus buries them and collapses from his injuries. Slavers find him and take him to the city of Zucchabar in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to gladiator trainer Proximo.

Maximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills helping him win matches and gain popularity. He befriends two other gladiators: Hagen, a German; and Juba, a Numidian. Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to "win the crowd" to win his freedom.

When Commodus organises 150 days of games to commemorate his father''s death, Proximo takes his gladiators to Rome to fight in the Colosseum. Disguised in a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in the Colosseum as a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle of Zama. Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to reveal his identity; Maximus removes his helmet and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let Maximus and the gladiators live.

Lucilla, Commodus''s sister and Maximus''s former lover, visits Maximus in his cell and offers her help, but he refuses. Meanwhile, Commodus arranges a duel between Maximus and a legendary undefeated gladiator, Tigris of Gaul. Several tigers are set upon Maximus during the duel, but he prevails. Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but Maximus spares his opponent''s life. In response, the crowd chants "Maximus the Merciful", which angers Commodus.

Maximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. He meets in secret with Lucilla and Gracchus, an influential senator. They agree to have Maximus escape Rome to join his legions, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate. Commodus learns of the plot when Lucilla''s son, Lucius, innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorian Guard arrest Gracchus and attack the gladiators'' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed.

To win back public approval, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus in the lung before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injuries, Maximus disarms Commodus during the duel. After the Praetorian Guard refuse to aid him, Commodus unsheathes a hidden knife; Maximus overpowers Commodus and drives the knife into his throat, killing him. Before Maximus succumbs to his wounds, he asks for political reforms, the freedom of his gladiator allies, and the reinstatement of Senator Gracchus. As he dies, Maximus envisions reuniting with his wife and son in the afterlife. His friends and allies honor him as "a soldier of Rome", at Lucilla''s behest, and carry his body out of the arena.

That night, Juba visits the Colosseum and buries figurines of Maximus''s wife and son at the spot where he died.', 'A betrayed Roman General watched his family murdered in cold blood and to worsen it he is stripped of his ranks.', 'gladiator.jpg'),

Returning to the Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D.''s headquarters, Rogers confronts Director Nick Fury and is briefed about Project Insight: three Helicarriers linked to spy satellites, designed to preemptively eliminate threats. Unable to decrypt Romanoff''s data, Fury becomes suspicious about Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official and Secretary of Internal Security Alexander Pierce to delay the project. On his way to rendezvous with Maria Hill, Fury is ambushed by assailants led by an assassin called the Winter Soldier. Escaping to Rogers'' apartment, Fury warns him that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised, but is shot by the Winter Soldier, before handing Rogers a flash drive containing the ship''s data. Fury is pronounced dead during surgery, and Hill recovers the body.

The next day, Pierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion. When Rogers withholds Fury''s information, Pierce brands him a fugitive. Hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., Rogers meets with Romanoff. Using the data, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a supercomputer containing the preserved consciousness of Arnim Zola. Zola informs them that after being captured by Rogers during World War II,[b] he was recruited to S.H.I.E.L.D., where he secretly reformed Hydra within its ranks, sowing global chaos to make humanity surrender its freedom in exchange for security, using the Winter Soldier as their primary assassin. The pair narrowly escape death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker, and realizes that Pierce is Hydra''s leader within S.H.I.E.L.D. Rogers and Romanoff enlist the help of VA employee and former USAF pararescueman Sam Wilson, whom Rogers befriended, and acquire a powered "Falcon" wingpack used by Wilson while he was in the Air Force.

They capture S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jasper Sitwell, a Hydra mole, forcing him to divulge that Zola developed a data-mining algorithm that can identify individuals becoming future threats to Hydra. The Insight Helicarriers will sweep the globe, using satellite-guided guns to eliminate them. Sitwell is killed in an ambush by the Winter Soldier, whom Rogers recognizes as Bucky Barnes, his longtime best friend previously thought dead; he had survived due to Zola''s experimentation and has been repeatedly brainwashed and cryogenically frozen to perform Hydra''s missions. Hill manages to extract the trio to a safehouse where Fury, who had faked his death, plans to sabotage the Helicarriers by replacing their controller chips.

After the World Security Council members arrive for the Helicarriers'' launch, Rogers broadcasts Hydra''s plot to everyone at the Triskelion. Romanoff, disguised as one of the Council members, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.''s database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Following a struggle, Fury fatally shoots Pierce. Rogers and Wilson raid two Helicarriers and replace the controller chips, but Barnes destroys Wilson''s suit and fights Rogers on the third. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other.

Rogers refuses to fight Barnes in an attempt to reach his friend, but as the ship collides with the Triskelion, Rogers falls into the Potomac River.

Thor frees himself, defeats Surtur, and takes his crown, believing he has prevented Ragnarök. Thor returns to Asgard to find Heimdall gone and his estranged brother Loki posing as Odin. He forces Loki to help find their father.

With directions from Stephen Strange, they find Odin in Norway. Odin explains that he is dying, Ragnarök is imminent despite Thor''s efforts, and his passing will free his firstborn child, Hela, from a prison she was sealed in long ago. Hela, a sibling Thor and Loki did not know existed, was leader of Asgard''s armies and conquered the Nine Realms with Odin, but he imprisoned her and wrote her out of history after she became too bloodthirsty and did not share his views on peace.

Odin dies and Hela appears, destroying Thor''s hammer Mjolnir. She pursues the two as they attempt to flee through the Bifröst Bridge, forcing them out into space. Arriving in Asgard, Hela defeats its army, slays the Warriors Three, and resurrects the ancient dead who once fought with her, including her giant wolf Fenris. She appoints the Asgardian Skurge as her executioner. Hela plans to use the Bifröst to expand Asgard''s empire, but Heimdall takes the sword that controls the Bifrost.

Thor is forced to compete in the Grandmaster''s Contest of Champions, facing his friend Hulk.

The next day, Sam notices that the penny has made her luck significantly improve. However, she soon loses the penny by inadvertently flushing it down a toilet.

As Sam bemoans her error, she encounters the cat again and tells him what happened, which causes the cat to berate her for losing the penny. Shocked, Sam follows the cat through a portal to the Land of Luck, where creatures like leprechauns create good luck for the people on Earth. The cat, named Bob, tells Sam he needs the penny for traveling purposes and that he will be banished if word gets out that he lost it. Bob and Sam make a deal to get another penny from the Penny depot for Hazel to use before returning it to Bob. Bob uses a button from Sam to pass off as a penny while she sneaks into the Land of Luck using clothes belonging to Bob''s personal leprechaun, Gerry.
